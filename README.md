# Mediawiki Progressive Web App Extension

> Progressive Web Apps, also known as Installable Web Apps or Hybrid Web Apps, are regular web pages (or websites) but can appear to the user like traditional applications or (native) mobile applications. This new application type attempts to combine features offered by most modern browsers with the benefits of mobile experience. (Wikipedia, Sep. 2017)
